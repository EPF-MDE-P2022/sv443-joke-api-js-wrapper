// I moved the whole code from this file to index.ts
// Because when I built the project before, it built 6 files (3 files for each)
// I don't want that. I wanted to have all my code in 3 files only.
// One for code, one for declarations and one for map

// I searched on google how to do this, but couldn't find any solutions.
// I think webpack or something else is needed

// TK Fix this problem
